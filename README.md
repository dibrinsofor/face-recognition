# face recognition

I'm learning to use opencv and built this as part of the learning process. This particular project so far just identifies Kanye West's face. **JIK**

*This project is pretty modular and can be used even if you do not understand open cv.*
### To start:
- fork and clone the repo 
- install all the dependencies in requirement.txt
```
run: pip install -r requirements.txt in your shell
```
- if you would like to be able to recognize some other person's face, navigate to the known_faces directory and create a folder with the name of the person and put a bunch if single faced pictures in.
- throw some more pictures into the unknown_faces directory.
- now you can run faceRec.py
```
python "faceRec.py"
```
### Result:

A bunch of windows will open up and all the identified faces will be tagged with the ame of the person.

To close the windows just press any key or the X button
